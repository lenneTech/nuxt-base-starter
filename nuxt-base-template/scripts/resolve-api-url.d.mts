/**
 * Public surface of `scripts/resolve-api-url.mjs` — the API-URL resolution
 * `generate-types` runs through (DEV-2802).
 *
 * The module itself is plain JavaScript on purpose: it is loaded by bare
 * `node scripts/generate-types.mjs` and by `openapi-ts.config.ts`, both outside
 * any build step. This file exists so specs can import it under `strict`
 * without `allowJs` — the same reason `scripts/check.d.mts` exists upstream —
 * and it doubles as the written-down contract of what the resolver exposes.
 *
 * No type-check gate covers it today: `nuxt typecheck`'s program is `app/**` +
 * `server/**`, so `scripts/**`, `openapi-ts.config.ts` and `tests/**` are all
 * outside it (the last is DEV-2900). Drift between this file and the `.mjs` is
 * therefore caught by the export-surface assertion in
 * `tests/unit/generate-types-api-url.spec.ts`, not by the compiler.
