/**
 * Resolve the API base URL `generate-types` generates the client from.
 *
 * Template source: nuxt-base-starter/nuxt-base-template/scripts/resolve-api-url.mjs
 * — keep both copies in sync; fixes belong upstream first.
 *
 * Why this exists (DEV-2802): `openapi-ts.config.ts` used to read
 * `process.env.NUXT_API_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'`. On a machine running
 * several lt projects in parallel, port 3000 belongs to *whichever* project
 * happens to hold it — so a shell without the `lt dev up` variables generated
 * `types.gen.ts` / `sdk.gen.ts` from a FOREIGN OpenAPI contract, reported
 * success and exited 0. The damage only surfaced much later, far away from the
 * cause.
 *
 * The contract implemented here:
 *
 *   1. An explicit `NUXT_API_URL` wins — CI, Docker and `lt dev up` all set it.
 *   2. Otherwise `<repo-root>/.lt-dev/.env` supplies it, so the documented
 *      `pnpm run generate-types` works under `lt dev up` without extra env.
 *   3. Otherwise the run FAILS with an actionable message. There is deliberately
 *      no default: guessing a port is exactly the bug.
 *   4. A URL that provably belongs to a DIFFERENT `lt dev` project fails too —
 *      that is the "wrong API answers wrong frontend" class `lt dev` otherwise
 *      protects against.
 *
 * The bridge file is read on BOTH paths, not only as a URL fallback: it also
 * carries `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` for the Caddy local CA, and the need for that
 * trust anchor does not depend on where the URL came from. Coupling the two
 * broke the tool's own documented escape hatch (`NUXT_API_URL=… pnpm run
 * generate-types` died with `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`).
 *
 * A guard that silently stops guarding recreates the very bug it was added for,
 * so every branch that cannot check something says so via `warnings` instead of
 * returning quietly.
 *
 * Everything is dependency-injected (`env`, `cwd`, `homeDir`, `readTextFile`)
 * so the rules are unit-testable without touching the real machine.
