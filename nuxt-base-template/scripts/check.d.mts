/**
 * Public surface of `scripts/check.mjs` — the pure helpers its guard imports.
 *
 * The runner itself is plain JavaScript on purpose (it must run via bare
 * `node scripts/check.mjs`, before any install or build step exists). This file
 * exists so `tests/unit/nuxt-builddir-isolation.test.ts` can import those
 * helpers under `strict` without `allowJs` or a `@ts-expect-error` bypass — and
 * it doubles as the written-down contract of what the runner exposes.
 *
 * Only the exported helpers belong here. Everything else in check.mjs is
 * internal and must stay unimported, so the guard cannot start a check run as a
 * side effect (the module's `isCliEntry()` gate is what makes that safe).

 * `nuxt dev` reads. That responsibility now sits where it belongs: every
 * `check:*` script in package.json carries its own `cross-env NUXT_BUILD_DIR=`
 * prefix on the `install` and `audit` it starts with.
 *
 * Declaring the pin at the call site beats inferring it from a command string —
 * the regex had to keep pace with every spelling (`pnpm i`, `pnpm add`,
 * `npm ci`, `bun install`, …) and silently missed the ones it did not know.
 * `tests/unit/nuxt-builddir-isolation.test.ts` asserts the new arrangement:
 * that the scripts themselves declare it, for every entry point.
