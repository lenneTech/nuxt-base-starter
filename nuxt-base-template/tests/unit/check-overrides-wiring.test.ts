/**
 * How `scripts/check-overrides.mjs` sits in the check chain. The guard itself is covered by
 * check-overrides.guard.spec.ts; this file covers the two places it can be lost on the way.
 *
 * 1. The chain. A guard nobody calls verifies nothing, and nothing fails when it drops out of
 *    `check:raw`, `check:fix` or `check:naf`.
 * 2. The report. The guard exits 0 on its degraded paths (no audit report, npm's advisory service
 *    down, suppressions the Advisory API did not answer for), because an outage elsewhere must not
 *    block a release. An unclassified step renders exit 0 as a plain tick, so a run that checked
 *    nothing would read like one that checked everything. The runner reads the guard's verdict
 *    back out of its output instead, as it already does for check-suppressions.mjs.
