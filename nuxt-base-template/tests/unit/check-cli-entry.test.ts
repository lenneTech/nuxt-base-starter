/**
 * Guards the "importing check.mjs must not start a check run" contract.
 *
 * `tests/unit/nuxt-builddir-isolation.test.ts` imports the runner to assert its pure
 * helpers. If the `isCliEntry()` gate ever regresses, that import kicks off the full
 * pipeline — install, build, boot a server — inside the test process. The suite then
 * never returns, and in CI that surfaces as a job timeout with no diagnosis at all.
 *
 * Run OUT OF PROCESS with a timeout, so a regression fails this one test in seconds
 * instead of hanging the runner it would otherwise take down with it.
