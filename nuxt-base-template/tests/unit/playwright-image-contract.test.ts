/**
 * Guards the cross-repo Playwright pin, from the side that actually breaks it.
 *
 * `lt-monorepo` pins the Playwright CI image (`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:vX.Y.Z-noble`)
 * for the `@playwright/test` version that lives HERE. Neither pins the other, and
 * `lt fullstack init` clones whatever is on this repo's main — so bumping the package
 * here silently invalidates the image over there. The generated project then fails
 * `check:playwright-image`, a step with nothing to do with the project itself.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: it happened for eleven days between 2.18.0 (which raised
 * the package to 1.62.1) and the monorepo catching up. Nobody noticed because the only
 * guard that compares the two — `lt-monorepo/scripts/check-playwright-image.mjs` —
 * cannot run in the repo that owns the pin: its `projects/` is empty by design, so it
 * always takes the skip path.
 *
 * This test closes that direction. The repo whose bump CAUSES the drift is the one
 * that goes red, while the bump is still in front of the person making it.
 *
 * **Opt-in, never a blocking gate.** It reaches over the network to a repository this
 * one does not control, so a GitHub outage or a rate limit must not fail an unrelated
 * MR. It runs when `CHECK_CROSS_REPO=1` (or in CI where that is set deliberately) and
 * skips otherwise — loudly enough to be noticed when the pin matters.
 *
 * Runs in the `node` environment, not the project-wide `happy-dom`: a real cross-origin
 * fetch is blocked by the Same-Origin Policy there, which this test would then report
 * as "network unavailable" and skip — passing while checking nothing.
 *
 * When it fails, the fix is in lt-monorepo, not here: raise the three image pins in
 * `.gitlab-ci.yml` (two jobs) and `.github/workflows/test.yml` (one) to match, and
 * release. Keep them moving in lockstep — the prebuilt image ships the matching browser
 * binaries and neither pipeline runs `playwright install`.
