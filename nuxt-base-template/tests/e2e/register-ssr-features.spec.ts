/**
 * The register form depends on backend feature flags — `signUpChecks` adds the
 * terms checkbox. `useLtAuth()` fetches those flags on the CLIENT only, so the
 * server rendered the form without the checkbox and the client, once the flags
 * arrived, with it. In the production build the flags arrive before hydration
 * finishes, and every visit to /auth/register logged "Hydration completed but
 * contains mismatches". In `nuxt dev` the client is slow enough to hydrate first,
 * so the mismatch never shows locally.
 *
 * Asserted on the SERVER html rather than in the browser for exactly that reason:
 * the console error depends on timing, the server html does not.
 *
 * Knowing the flags on the server has a side effect on disabled sign-up: the page's
 * redirect watcher would fire there, and a server redirect carries no payload, so the
 * toast explaining it was lost. The second test pins that the redirect stays on the
 * client; it only runs against a backend with sign-up disabled.
 *
 * Independent of the database state: a spec before this one may have deleted every
 * user, and with zero users the setup middleware redirects /auth/register to
 * /auth/setup — the page under test would never render. The system is set up through
 * the API when needed, and that admin is removed afterwards. If init answers 403 with
 * zero users, a previous spec left its `system-setup-locks` claim behind (see the
 * nest-server system-setup INTEGRATION-CHECKLIST).
