/**
 * What analytics may learn about a page, and nothing more.
 *
 * Nothing that names a person or opens an account leaves the page, whichever server receives it:
 * no token or code, no e-mail address, no record id, no click id, no free text. Before 2.35.0 a reset
 * link handed its live token to the analytics host on its first request, and `verify-email` added
 * the address. What does leave, and only that:
 *
 * - the path, every segment that could identify somebody replaced by {@link MASK},
 * - the campaign labels in {@link CAMPAIGN_PARAMS}, only with a value that is a plain label,
 * - `gclid` and `msclkid` as `1`, so a paid click still counts while its id stays on the page.
 *
 * Every other query parameter and the fragment are dropped. The rules are allowlists, so a new page
 * or parameter needs no change here to stay private. The one thing a rule cannot see is a short code
 * behind a fixed word (`/s/aB3dE`): a project adds that word to {@link PROJECT_TOKEN_SEGMENTS}.
 *
 * A path that resolves to one of the app's own static routes keeps every segment (see
 * {@link staticRoutes}): it holds nothing but the code's own words, so `/invite/accept` stays itself
 * next to `/invite/[code]`. The masks are for dynamic routes and for paths no route knows.
 *
 * Custom events (`useTrackEvent`, `window.plausible`) report `location.href` unless they get a `url`,
 * so they pass `analyticsUrl(window.location.href)`, and their props carry no personal data: no
 * e-mail, no name, no id.
