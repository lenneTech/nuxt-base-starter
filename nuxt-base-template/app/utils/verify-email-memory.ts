/**
 * Where `/auth/verify-email` keeps what it needs across a reload: in the history entry, never in the URL.
 *
 * "Send a new e-mail" needs the address, and it used to travel as `?email=` from the login and the
 * sign-up. In the URL it went to analytics, into the referrer of links, into the browser history
 * and into every link somebody pasted while asking for help. The history entry keeps it out of all
 * of that and still survives a reload of the page.
 *
 * Login and sign-up hand it over with `navigateTo({ path, state: verifyEmailState(email) })`. The
 * link in the verification mail carries `token` (and, before nest-server 12.6.0, `email`), so the
 * page moves both out of the URL the moment it has read them. A link the server refused leaves its
 * token here, because from nest-server 12.6.0 on that token is what asks for a new mail.
