/**
 * The absolute origin to build auth redirect URLs from.
 *
 * Why this exists: Better Auth validates `redirectTo` / `callbackURL` against its
 * trusted origins and answers 403 INVALID_REDIRECT_URL for anything it cannot match.
 * A template string over a missing config value does not fail loudly — it produces
 * the literal text `"undefined"`, which is what reached production:
 *
 *     {"email":"…","redirectTo":"undefined/auth/reset-password"}   → 403
 *
 * A relative path is not an alternative: Better Auth resolves it with
 * `new URL(callbackURL, ctx.baseURL)` against the **API** origin, so it would point
 * at `api.<host>` rather than the app.
 *
 * `configured` wins when it parses as a usable absolute URL — a deployment behind a
 * public hostname that differs from the origin the browser sees (a proxy, a vanity
 * domain) needs to be able to say so. Everything else falls back to the origin the
 * request actually came from, which is by definition an origin the app is served under.
 *
 * Only the *origin* is kept. A configured value carrying a path, query, or embedded
 * credentials would otherwise be baked into every URL built from it, and the
 * downstream check compares origins — so it would never notice the junk.
 *
 * Returns `''` on the server, where there is no window to fall back to. Callers that
 * need a URL should use {@link appUrl}, which turns that into a thrown error rather
 * than a silently relative link.
 *
 * The server check is `typeof window`, not `import.meta.client`: the latter is a
 * bundler-replaced build flag that is absent outside a Nuxt build (unit tests among
 * them), where it silently reads as `undefined` and would send every caller down the
 * server branch.
 *
 * @param configured Usually `useRuntimeConfig().public.siteUrl`, fed by `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
 * @see https://github.com/lenneTech/nuxt-base-starter — `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `.env.example`

 * wrong host. That is the same silently-wrong class as the `"undefined/…"` bug this
 * module exists to prevent, so it fails at the call instead.
 *
 * `path` must be a single-slash absolute path, under the same contract as
 * {@link safeRedirectTarget} — no protocol-relative `//`, no backslash variant, no
 * control characters. Every current caller passes a literal, but the signature
 * invites a variable and both symbols are auto-imported project-wide.
 *
 * @param path Absolute path with a single leading slash, e.g. `/auth/reset-password`.
 * @param configured Usually `useRuntimeConfig().public.siteUrl`.
 * @throws If `path` is not a valid absolute path, or if no origin can be resolved
 *   (server-side with nothing configured).
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const config = useRuntimeConfig();
 * await authClient.requestPasswordReset({
 *   email,
 *   redirectTo: appUrl('/auth/reset-password', config.public.siteUrl),
 * });
