/**
 * Validates a `?redirect=` query value into a safe same-origin navigation target.
 *
 * `auth.global` sends an unauthenticated visitor to
 * `/auth/login?redirect=<the page they wanted>` (as `to.fullPath`). Three places read
 * that value back: `guest.global` for someone already signed in, and the `login` and
 * `2fa` pages after a successful sign-in. All three MUST agree on what is valid —
 * when they did not, one of them accepted shapes the others rejected.
 *
 * What this accepts: a single-slash absolute path (`/app/records/42?tab=x#y`).
 * What it rejects, and why:
 *
 * - `//evil.com` — protocol-relative; the browser resolves it to another origin.
 * - `/\evil.com` — the same attack via backslash, which browsers normalise to `/`.
 * - a tab, newline or carriage return anywhere in the value — the WHATWG URL parser
 *   strips those from input BEFORE resolving, so `/<TAB>/evil.com` becomes
 *   `//evil.com`, i.e. the first case wearing a disguise. A lookahead that inspects
 *   only the character after the leading slash cannot see this, which is why the
 *   control-character test is separate rather than folded into a cleverer regex.
 *   The whole C0 range plus DEL is rejected: none of it belongs in a route, and an
 *   allowlist of "the three that are known to be strippable" would have to be
 *   revisited every time a URL parser changes its mind.
 * - a non-string (`?redirect=/a&redirect=/b` yields an array, a bare `?redirect`
 *   yields `null`).
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT reject: percent-encoded slashes (`/%2f%2fevil.com`).
 * vue-router resolves those as a literal path segment, so the target stays
 * same-origin — it is a 404, not a redirect. Pinned by a test so the decision stays
 * deliberate rather than accidental.
 *
 * This is not the only layer: `navigateTo` refuses external targets unless
 * `external: true`. But relying on that alone was what produced the bug this
 * function exists to prevent — the throw surfaces as "Ein unerwarteter Fehler ist
 * aufgetreten" to a user who IS by then signed in. Validating at the read site turns
 * a confusing failure into a silent, correct fallback.
