/**
 * Keeps a password-reset link across a reload of the page it arrived on, and nowhere else.
 *
 * `reset-password.vue` strips the token from the URL, so a reload would otherwise find none and
 * call a valid link dead. Remembering it is the risk: on a shared device the next person in the
 * tab must not receive it, or they can set the previous person's password.
 *
 * So the link is bound to the history entry that received it: a random id in `history.state`, and
 * the same id next to the token in `sessionStorage`. A reload keeps the entry and with it the id.
 * A redirect lands on an entry without that id, which "the document was reloaded" cannot tell
 * apart, because a reload counts for the whole document and not for one page of the app.
 *
 * The id alone is not enough either. "Back" onto a document the app did not render, such as a
 * proxy's error page or a maintenance page, runs no code of ours, and the reload after it still
 * finds the id and the link. So the memory also expires: `pagehide` stamps it, and it only counts
 * for `RELOAD_WINDOW_MS` after that, whatever ran or did not run in between.
 *
 * `sessionStorage` throws when storage is blocked (private modes, site-data settings). Every
 * access below fails safely: a reload then loses the link, as it did before this memory existed.
